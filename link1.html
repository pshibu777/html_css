    <p>Content itself is what the user derives value from. Thus, "content" can refer to the information provided through the medium, the way in which the information was presented, as well as the added features included in the medium in which that information was delivered. The medium, however, provides little to no value to the end-user without the information and experiences that make up the content. Communication theory philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously coined the phrase, "The medium is the message." In the case of content, the channel through which information is delivered, the "medium", affects how the end user perceives content, the "message".</p>
